#Aro's Heartstring
The Quiver contains all of Aro's plug-ins, core, and everything. The admin setup and default core are designed as plug-ins themselves, and can be exchanged, as the plug-in loader itself is stored separately. 

3rd party plug-ins can be inserted in the /quiver/ directory (for plug-ins that do not alter core functionality) and plug-ins that do alter core functionality will be placed directly in this directory. 

The installer will help manage that once we establish permissions.
